Introduction

In terms of movement, legged robots are different from wheeled robots, aerial robots, etc. Compared with traditional wheeled mobile robots, legged robots have the ability to overcome obstacles and adapt to complex terrain, so they have a considerable advantage in completing certain tasks in complex terrain, such as disaster scene rescue.

At the same time, the legged robots themselves have the idea of bionics that imitates the characteristics of foot-dependent animals such as human beings. Actually human beings and other high-level animals have tens of billions of neurons, and they have flexible and complex control thinking and strategies, so for legged robots, the mechanical structure design, actuators, and the cooperation between the sensory units becomes very important. And one more important thing is that, the control method of footed robots is very critical, a high-level controller can allow the robot to get a fast and stable response to complex tasks and scenarios in a short period of time.

For footed robots, gait control is also very critical, and the current idea of gait control for footed robots in fact mimics the gait movement of animals such as humans. At the same time, for animals relying on foot movement, the end of the foot only touch the ground and vacate two states, touch the ground state corresponding to the mechanical leg is called the support leg, the vacate state corresponding to the mechanical leg is called the swing leg. Whether bipedal or quadrupedal robots, each foot end periodically switches between these two states when they are travelling.
