Hi, Robotics!
===================================

This is the documentation for Robotics related technical notebook.

The purpose of this project is to share various aspects related to robotics, including theoretical knowledge, algorithms, robotics community, robotics industry, robotics conferences, and the latest papers in the direction of robotics, and so on.

This project can also be understood as my daily writing and learning record. Since the author is still a novice in the field of robotics, some technical details or theoretical proofs may not be very accurate and professional. If you have different views on the content or find some errors, you are very welcome to contact me to discuss the modification!

I hope this document can accompany you to explore the fascinating world of robotics!
